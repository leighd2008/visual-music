## Visual Music WebApp

An app that converts your favorite music pieces into visual expressions.

Visual Music is a collaboration project managed by a group of dedicated fellow students. Aimed at all music and arts lovers, it provides the users with a real time visual transcription of a streamed music piece.

If the visual transcription can be at first of random assignment of colors and shapes, it shouldn't remain so, as **one of the main interest is to transcribe the emotional effects of the music piece**. Therefore, questions will araise as perception is highly cultural and language induced. It might be interesting in a second time to create various themes based on those considerations for the visual transcription.

## Applications

The applications could be :

-   the possibility to screen the visual expression as background for parties, concerts and stages,
-   accessibility, by giving a visual transcription of music pieces, making them accessible to the hearing impaired,
-   creation of original objects, with the possibility of a screen capture going with a downloadable HD print file, the possibility of printing, framing and offering the painting of a song to friends and family,
-   tool or interesting experiment for musicologists, linguists, scientists, etc.

## Technology/Stack:

-   [Figma](https://www.figma.com/): to design the UI
-   [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/): to test and export the UI components for React
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/): to build the UI
-   [p5](https://p5js.org/): for visualization
    -   using [react-p5-wrapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-p5-wrapper))
-   [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
-   [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/): to build and test the deployed app

**Idea:** We want to analyse the data from an uploaded mp3 song, and process it through p5.js. We are not building a player, and not building a simple visualizer: we want to think on how to transcribe the music in an artistic way.

This means that a dive into visual music theory is necessary. Understanding music theory would allow us to build features such as offering different themes/options based on:

-   the **notes**
    -   color of tone = amount of overtones
    -   frequency/pitch/hertz
    -   volume/amplitude/decibels
-   the **character** of the music, which can be specified by 3 components:
    -   tone of the music piece (major, minor)
    -   the tempo / character
    -   the bar / measure
-   the **rhythm** which can generally be identified from the repetition of different components:
    -   notes
    -   duration of notes
    -   sequencing of notes  
        --> This is ultimately the musical expression of the score: a score contains both the notes to play, the duration they must have and of course in what order and how fast play them

## Release & Launch

Visual Music is being built with the intention of releasing and maintaining the project in the real world. Therefore providing contributors with a great opportunity to expand on and learn new skills, being part of a project that can be included on resumes and showed off to friends, family and potential employers.

A survey for team members is on the Trello board to discuss where and how the app should be released.
